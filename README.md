# Moore Law

Moore was a founding member of Fairchild Semiconductor and head of research. Moore's law states that the number of components on a computer chip doubles every two years. Moore anticipated that every two years, the number of transistors on a single square inch of an integrated circuit chip would double.

## Extending Moore Law

Unfortunately, the rate of technological advancement has not decreased, and we are approaching the conclusion of Moore's Law. Many in the business are hesitant to make firm predictions about when the concept will become obsolete, but the general assumption is that it will happen between 2020 and 2025 â€” and no one appears to have a viable answer to this technological stumbling block.
